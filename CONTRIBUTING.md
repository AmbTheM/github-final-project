All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome. Responsibilities

The DEV will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

Coordinating the technical direction of the Project.
Approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope).
Organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects.
Creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements.
Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities.
Establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies.
Approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing.
The DEV voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the CONTRIBUTING file within the Project’s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in this CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.
